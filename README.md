-# Auto-Generated Quiz Maker

This project generates quiz questions automatically from lesson content using a pre-trained AI model.

## Problem
Creating educational quizzes manually is time-consuming. Instructors and learners need faster ways to assess understanding.

## Solution
This tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to instantly generate multiple-choice or short-answer questions from a given paragraph or lesson content.

## How It Works
- Input any educational content (e.g., article, textbook paragraph)
- The app uses a pre-trained transformer model (`valhalla/t5-base-qg-hl`) to generate relevant questions
- You get 2–5 quiz questions in seconds

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Gradio (for the web interface)
- Google Colab (for demo)

## Demo
